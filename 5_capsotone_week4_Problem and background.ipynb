    "As you may know, **Lisbon** is blooming with tourists.<br>\n",

    "This situation raises a huge economic and social concern.Luckily there are great examples that we can learn from, such as New York city and Toronto. Being one of the top destinations for tourists worldwide since years, they still provide diversity and quality for all tastes. <br>\n",
    "Therefore this project aims to provide insights from these two cities, which will definitely aid **business owners and all the stakeholders, including local authorities and the citizens**, to succeed and hence, make **Lisbon a great destination** for all."
