    "The __aim__ of this project is to find the top venues in two of the top destinations for tourists, and hence, help business owners, entrepreneurs, local authorities and all the stakeholders to make conscious decisions. Ultimately it will **benefit the citizens and improve the touristic experience with top offers** \n",

    "Therefore, we will explore each city to get their top venues and then compare both.<br>\n",
    "If there are common aspects, they will be on the top choice **list for new venues in Lisbon***.<br>\n",
    "Additionally, I aim to map clusters of the top venues in both cities to visually understand how different/similar are they. \n",
